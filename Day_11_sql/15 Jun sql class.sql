# ddl commands you might use 
#CREATE - to create objects in the database. db , table
#ALTER - alters the structure of the database.
#DROP - delete objects from the database.
#TRUNCATE - remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
#COMMENT - add comments to the data dictionary.
#RENAME - rename an object.
