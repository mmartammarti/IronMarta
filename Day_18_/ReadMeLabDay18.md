# Can we predict churn in telecomunication companies?

##### Drawing on either logistical regression model you have seen in the week (ie, pick one!) we would like you to submit for this lab on one slide (google slide, pdf, or ppt, or other format you prefer) which summarises:

- Being able to predict churn with Machine Learning will help the business to prevent loss.
- Heatmap would be a very useful tool to see what do we have in terms of useful data in order to see if our ML model is realistic.

1. Heatmap:

From analyzing the visual data we extract the following deuctions:
 1. it is hard to extract a useful ML model with the data we have now because
 2. multicollinearity might be applying too
 3. getting wider customer data and historical examples of clients with and without churn would help to build a more effective ML model.
